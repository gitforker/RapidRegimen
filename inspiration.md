Development notes and random thoughts
=====================================

- Consider basing this on / using some of the following projects/components..
- Integration with OpenMRS?
- USSD support by VuMi <http://vumi.org/features/>
- Check out: Motech's pillreminder demo on GitHub <https://github.com/motech/pill-reminder-demo>
- *For scheduling look at this implementation:* <http://www.motechproject.org/modules/message-campaign.html>
- IVR vs. USSD (would IVR be possible in Bissau?)
